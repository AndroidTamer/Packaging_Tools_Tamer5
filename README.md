# Android Tamer Package Builder : Tamer 5

This VM is close replica of AndroidTamer build and has additional tools build
in to facilitate building of packages. 
This is intentionally kept vanilla and no GUI as that's not required for both
compiling processes. Also it should be noted that this doesn't have s3config
file and keys in it which are used to sign the Packages.

The Scripts are made available in the interest of Full Disclosure and
Contribution of new build scripts are highly appreciated and welcome.
